            Welcome to Ink Bar — where bold ink meets bold drinks. 
            We’re more than a tattoo studio and more than a bar. 
            We’re your next obsession.

              Welcome to <strong>Ink Bar</strong> — a place where bold drinks meet bold ink, and creative energy flows just as freely as our craft cocktails. We're not your average bar, and we're definitely not your average tattoo studio. Instead, we’ve built a space where self-expression, artistry, and community come together in an unforgettable atmosphere.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
              Our mission is simple: to celebrate individuality and inspire connection. Whether you're getting a custom piece from one of our resident tattoo artists, sipping a smoked bourbon cocktail at the bar, or vibing to our live DJ sets, Bar & Ink is a space that welcomes the curious, the creative, and the unapologetically original. We believe everyone has a story to tell — and we're here to help you tell it in ink, on skin, or over drinks.
            </p> -->
            <p>
              The space is gritty yet warm, industrial yet intimate — a reflection of the people who fill it. From late-night flash events to weekend tasting menus, no two nights are the same. Come alone, come with friends, or come to meet strangers who feel like you've known them for years. One thing’s for sure: you’ll come for the vibe, and you’ll stay because it feels like home.

              At the heart of Bar & Ink is our in-house tattoo studio — a space where creativity, precision, and bold self-expression collide. Our team of seasoned tattoo artists brings a wide range of styles to the table, from clean minimal linework to complex full-color pieces and neo-traditional murals. Whether it’s your first tattoo or your fiftieth, we take the time to turn your ideas into wearable art.
            </p>        
            <!-- <p>
              The studio is fully licensed, health-code compliant, and equipped with state-of-the-art tools and sterilization protocols. Every session is held to the highest standards of hygiene and safety, ensuring not just stunning results but peace of mind. Our artists are more than technicians — they’re collaborators who take your story and translate it into ink that lasts a lifetime.

            <p>
              Walk-ins are always welcome during our popular Flash Nights, where we drop exclusive, limited-run designs in a high-energy setting. Or book a private session for a custom piece crafted just for you. The vibe is relaxed, the music’s loud, and inspiration hangs in the air — just the way we like it.

              Our bar is more than just a place to grab a drink — it’s an extension of the Bar & Ink experience. We’ve curated a unique selection of craft beers, signature cocktails, and small-batch bourbons that complement the creative, rebellious energy of our tattoo studio. Whether you're winding down after a session or meeting up with friends, our menu has something to surprise your taste buds.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Every night has its own vibe: from laid-back lounge evenings to electrifying DJ sets that pulse with underground beats. We host weekly themed nights — think “Black Ink Fridays,” “Tattoo & Tonic Tuesdays,” and rotating bartender collabs — so there’s always something new to discover. Our mixologists take pride in pushing boundaries, just like our artists.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              So pull up a stool, sip something daring, and soak in the atmosphere — walls lined with flash art, vintage neon, and the hum of tattoo machines in the background. This isn’t your average bar. It’s where the inked come to drink, and the bold come to life.
